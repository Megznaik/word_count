# Text Analysis and Word Cloud Generation

This repository contains Python code to analyze text and generate a word cloud from a given text. The code processes the text, removes stopwords, and creates a word cloud visualization to represent the frequency of words in the text.

## Introduction
The code provided analyzes a given text to identify the frequency of words and generates a word cloud visualization. The main steps of the process include:

1. Tokenizing the text into individual words.
2. Removing stopwords and punctuation.
3. Creating a frequency distribution of words.
4. Generating a word cloud based on the frequency distribution.

## Dependencies
To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
wordcloud
matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib

## Installation
To use this code, you can clone this repository using Git:
git clone https://github.com/Megznaik/word_count.git

## Usage
1. Provide the text you want to analyze in the text variable.
2. Run the Python script Word_Count.py.
3. The script will output a word cloud visualization representing the frequency of words in the text.
